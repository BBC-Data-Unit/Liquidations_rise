# Liquidations_rise
The background and data behind the Shared Data Unit's recent regional study of UK business insolvencies 

In June 2023, the Shared Data Unit carried out an investigation into business liquidations across the UK - looking at how areas had been affected differently.

We found that some parts of the UK saw a fivefold increase in firms closing down in 2022, compared to the year prior to the pandemic.

Two towns in the London commuter belt, Havering and Southend-on-Sea saw the biggest rise.

Experts pointed to the withdrawal of government support and soaring energy costs as creating the record insolvency levels in the UK - with retail and construction the hardest hit industries.

The government said it had provided around £400bn of support to businesses since the pandemic.

The Shared Data Unit analysed creditors’ voluntary liquidation notices on the London Gazette between 2019 and 2022 and mapped them to 221 upper-tier local authorities across the UK. 

We found:

- 187 out of 221 upper tier authorities in the UK (85%) saw a rise in liquidations comparing 2019 to 2022
- Commuter belt areas on the outskirts of London made up five of the top ten authorities with the largest proportional rise
- On a regional level, the East of England saw the biggest rise of 78%, while the South West of England saw the smallest at 31%
